# Net-Present-Value

This is a python data analysis project for the Net Present Value of a company's project in financial analysis, specifically 2 projects, to determine the profitability of each project and which project deserves to be invested in.

Both Project A and Project B have a startup capital of $2,000,000 at a discount rate of 5% for each project.
The Internal Rate of Return in my analysis is higher for Project A, making Project A more profitable to invest in.
